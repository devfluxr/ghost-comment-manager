Trust once → comments auto-publish with a moderator-only “ghost” flag. Includes a light spam shield, filters, bulk actions, and a clear dashboard.

== Description ==

Ghost Comment Manager is designed to reduce the time you spend moderating comments. Instead of re-approving the same people over and over, you mark a person as Trusted one time. From then on:

- Their new comments publish immediately.
- A subtle “ghost” indicator is shown to moderators only so you can spot and confirm at your convenience.
- Visitors see a normal comment; nothing changes on the public site.

Alongside this workflow improvement, the plugin includes a lightweight Shield that blocks common spam patterns without external services. A simple dashboard gives you live counts and a clear picture of what is happening.

This plugin focuses on workflow, clarity, and speed. It plays nicely with Akismet or Antispam Bee if you already use them.

=== Why use this plugin ===

1. Save time: stop re-approving loyal commenters.
2. Stay safe: every trusted comment is highlighted to moderators until confirmed.
3. Cut spam: built-in Shield blocks common abusive behavior before it reaches your queue.
4. See everything: a simple dashboard with trusted totals and block reasons.
5. Keep control: bulk trust/untrust, user-profile control, and comment-screen filters.

== Features ==

Core workflow
- Trust / Untrust a user from the Comments list.
- Auto-trust after X approved comments (configurable).
- Ghosted auto-publish for trusted users (mod-only highlight until confirmed).
- One-click Confirm to remove the ghost indicator.
- Role exclusions so specific roles (for example Editors) publish normally without ghosting.
- Custom ghost indicator icon and background color.

Shield Lite (no external API)
- Honeypot field that bots tend to fill.
- Minimum submit time to stop instant bot posts.
- Rate limits per IP (per minute and per hour).
- Maximum links per comment.
- Keyword and regular expression blocklist.
- Auto-close comments on old posts after X days.
- Minimum and maximum comment length.
- Duplicate comment protection within a time window.

Moderation UX
- Comment-screen filters:
  - Pending (New Users): only untrusted comments awaiting approval.
  - Ghost (Trusted): approved comments still awaiting moderator confirmation.
- Bulk actions: Trust or Untrust the user associated with selected comments.
- Trust from the User Profile screen (checkbox).

UI and Dashboard
- Colorful dashboard cards for trusted users, ghost-pending count, and totals.
- Shield Lite “blocks by reason” table.
- Clean and organized settings pages.
- “Pro Features” preview tab (coming soon items).

Integrations and compatibility
- Respects Akismet / Antispam Bee: if a comment is flagged as spam, this plugin does not ghost-mark or auto-approve it.
- Works with block themes and classic themes.
- Multisite compatible on a per-site basis.

== How it works (non-technical) ==

Approve vs Trust
- Approve: you approve one comment.
- Trust: you approve the person. Future comments publish immediately and are temporarily highlighted for moderators.

Ghost indicator (moderator-only)
- Public visitors see a normal comment.
- Logged-in moderators see a subtle highlighted background and icon.
- Click Confirm when you are satisfied; the highlight disappears, the comment remains published.

Auto-trust threshold
- Set a number in settings (for example, 3).
- When a user reaches that many approved comments, they automatically become trusted.
- Changing the number later affects future users; it does not remove trust from people you already trusted.

Role exclusions
- Choose roles that should never be ghosted (for example Administrators or Editors). Their comments still publish, but without the moderator highlight.

Shield Lite
- Blocks common spam patterns quietly before they hit your queue.
- Defaults are safe; you can adjust limits and rules to fit your site.

== Step-by-step setup ==

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Open Ghost Comments → Settings → General:
   - Set “Auto-trust after X approvals” (0 disables auto-trust).
   - Choose any roles to exclude from ghosting.
   - Pick an icon and background color for the moderator-only ghost indicator.
3. Open Ghost Comments → Settings → Shield Lite:
   - Keep Honeypot on.
   - Set Minimum submit time (3–5 seconds is typical).
   - Set rate limits (for example 6 per minute and 60 per hour).
   - Set the maximum number of links (for example 2).
   - Add any keywords or regular expressions to block.
   - Optionally auto-close comments on posts older than X days.
   - Adjust minimum/maximum length and duplicate time window to taste.
4. Start using it:
   - In Comments → All Comments, click “Trust User” on a real commenter.
   - Their next comments auto-publish with a moderator-only ghost indicator.
   - Click Confirm to remove the indicator when you’re ready.

== Compatibility, performance, privacy ==

Compatibility
- Works with WordPress 6.0 and newer, classic and block themes.
- Plays well with Akismet and Antispam Bee; if a comment is flagged as spam, it will not be ghost-marked or auto-approved by this plugin.
- Multisite: activate per site or network-wide; settings are per site.

Performance
- Lightweight by design. No front-end JavaScript for visitors. Shield Lite uses simple server checks and transients.

Privacy
- Stores minimal user meta to remember trusted status and counters for the dashboard.
- No data is sent to external services by this plugin.

== Troubleshooting ==

I trusted a user but their comment did not auto-publish
- Confirm the user is logged in with the same account you trusted.
- Check if another plugin is forcing all comments to be held for moderation.
- If Akismet flagged the comment as spam, it will not auto-publish.

Ghost highlight is not visible to moderators
- Ensure you are logged in with a role that can moderate comments.
- Confirm the comment belongs to a trusted user and has not already been confirmed.
- Check the indicator color in settings; choose a more visible color if needed.

Auto-trust threshold is set but users are not becoming trusted
- The threshold only counts approved comments after you enabled it.
- Set the threshold to a smaller number to test quickly.

Too many legitimate comments are blocked
- Lower the minimum submit time.
- Increase rate limits or set them to 0 to disable.
- Raise the maximum links or remove specific keywords/regexes from the blocklist.
- Reduce duplicate window time.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Does this replace Akismet/Antispam?**
No. It complements them. If Akismet (or another antispam plugin) flags a comment as spam, this plugin does not ghost-mark or approve it.

**What’s the difference between “Approve” and “Trust”?**
- **Approve** = one comment.
- **Trust** = the user (all future comments auto-publish with a temporary ghost flag until confirmed).

**Do visitors see the ghost flag/marker?**
No. Only logged-in users with moderation rights see it.

**Does it work with guests (unregistered commenters)?**
Trust is per **WordPress user account**, so guests are not auto-trusted. They can still comment—Shield Lite still protects you.

**Will changing the auto-trust threshold affect existing trusted users?**
No. It only affects users going forward.

**Can I exclude roles from ghosting?**
Yes. In **Settings → General**, you can exclude roles so their comments publish normally with no ghost flag.

**Does it work with block themes and the Comment block?**
Yes. The ghost flag/marker wraps the comment text for moderators only; public output is untouched.

**Multisite support?**
Yes. Works per-site. Network activate if you want it available network-wide; settings remain per individual site.

**Performance impact?**
Very small. Shield Lite uses simple checks and transients (no external API calls). No front-end JS is added for visitors.

**Can I export settings?**
Not in the free version. Export and analytics features are planned for Pro.

**Privacy – what data is stored?**
- **User meta**: `_gcm_trusted` (1/0), `_gcm_approved_count` (number).
- **Comment meta**: `_gcm_ghost` (1).
- **Options**: `gcm_settings` (your settings), `gcm_metrics` (dashboard counters).
- **Transients**: rate limit counters & duplicate hash (short-lived).

No data is sent to third parties.
